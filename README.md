## Overview

This data science project was created at UC San Diego, researching the relationship and correspondence between a recipe's total time and metadata such as tags, ingredient count, and number of steps. 

## Introduction

In the modern world, time is a valuable resource, and efficiency in the kitchen has become a priority for many. Whether you're a busy professional, a home cook, or someone exploring new recipes, knowing how long a recipe will take is crucial to meal planning.

Our project focuses on predicting recipe time based on metadata, using data science techniques. By analyzing a large dataset of recipes from food.com, we aim to uncover patterns in ingredient lists, cooking methods, and other metadata.

** Can we accurately predict total recipe time using the data we were given? **
